# NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim
I have just downloaded Isaac Sim and tried out some of the already existing examples on there but I would like to build a robotic project (that's not just a simple rc car) but I was thinking about adding the jetson nano or jetson orin nano to it so it can do more than just simple instructions.

I am planning on this project to be my next big project hopefully over this summer coming up as over winter I will be developing and finishing my ongoing projects as I don't want to leave anything unfinished before I move onto a new endeavour.

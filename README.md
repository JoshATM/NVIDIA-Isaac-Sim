# NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim
I have just downloaded Isaac Sim and tried out some of the already existing examples on there but I would like to build a robotic project (that's not just a simple rc car) but I was thinking about adding the jetson nano or jetson orin nano to it so it can do more than just simple instructions.
